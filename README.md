# Currency-Converter
This repository holds my first try at a Currency Converter. It converts four currencies: USD, JMD, EUR and CAD. The rate used to convert to and from these currencies was found on March 16, 2020 using Google's currency converter. Note: App built using Android Studio, debugger was my own device (One Plus 6) and it was coded in Java. I tried my best to place comments where I saw fit to aid in revision of my work. - XO
